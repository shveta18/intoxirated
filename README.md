1. The user must log in using their userID and password. If the password is incorrect that is flagged. A new user may also register for the app and use the login credentials to proceed. 
2. Once the user is logged in, they see a simple layout for querying the db across three options - Beer, Wine, Whiskey
3. The user can query based on a search criteria to retreive their rating
4. The user can query the db to search all their ratings across categories as well
5. The user can add a new rating if the record does not currently exist in the db. 
6. Since the app is sessions based, if the user is logged out after an hour, they must sign in again.
